# GQL Assist

GQL Assist is your go-to tool for supercharging GraphQL development. It simplifies writing GraphQL
queries for Apollo Client by converting them into TypeScript code, making your development process
smoother and error-free. On the server side, gql-assist streamlines API development in NestJS by
automatically converting TypeScript classes, resolvers, and enums into their GraphQL counterparts,
drastically reducing boilerplate code. With gql-assist, you can focus on building your application
while it handles the heavy lifting of GraphQL integration.

## Installation

To install GQL Assist, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install gql-assist
```

or

```bash
yarn add gql-assist
```

## Features

Discover the power of GraphQL Assist with its suite of robust functionalities:

### React Hook

Transform your GraphQL queries into TypeScript code seamlessly compatible with
[`@apollo/client`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/). With GraphQL Assist, writing GraphQL
queries for Apollo Client becomes a breeze, letting you concentrate on what matters mostâ€”building
your application.

### Server Side

Streamline your GraphQL API development in a [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start)
environment with GraphQL Assist. Automatically convert TypeScript classes, resolvers, and enums into
their GraphQL definitions, slashing boilerplate code and boosting productivity.

- **Model Conversion**: Instantly convert TypeScript classes to NestJS GraphQL Object Types for
  generating models, inputs, and response types.
- **Resolver Conversion**: Effortlessly transform resolver methods into GraphQL resolvers with the
  correct decorators.
- **Field Resolver Conversion**: Easily convert methods to GraphQL field resolvers with the
  necessary decorators.
- **Enum Conversion**: Swiftly transform TypeScript enums to GraphQL enums and register them.

## Usage

```sh
npx gql-assist generate decorator
```

### React Hook

GraphQL Assist can also help you with writing queries for graphql client by converting GraphQL
queries into TypeScript code compatible with `@apollo/client`. With GraphQL Assist, writing GraphQL
queries for Apollo Client becomes easier and less error-prone, allowing you to focus more on
building your application.

```sh
npx gql-assist generate hook
```

#### Example

Given the following GraphQL query:

```ts
import gql from 'graphql-tag'

const query = gql`
  query {
    user {
      name
    }
  }
```

GraphQL Assist will look at the schema and convert it to the following on save:

```ts
import { QueryHookOptions, useQuery } from '@apollo/client'
import gql from 'graphql-tag'

const query = gql`
  query fetchUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      name
    }
  }
`

export interface RequestType {
  id: string | undefined
}

export interface QueryType {
  user?: UserType
}

export interface UserType {
  name?: string
  __typename?: 'User'
}

export function useUserQuery(
  request: RequestType,
  options?: QueryHookOptions<QueryType, RequestType>,
) {
  return useQuery<QueryType, RequestType>(query, {
    variables: request,
    skip: !request.id,
    ...options,
  })
}
```

### Models

For GQL Assist to recognize and convert a TypeScript class into a GraphQL ObjectType, it should be
placed in a file with the extension `.model.ts`.

#### Example

Given the following TypeScript class:

```ts
export class User {
  id!: string
  name?: string
  email?: string
  bio?: string
  role?: UserRole
}
```

GQL Assist will convert it to:

```ts
import { Field, ID, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@ObjectType()
export class User {
  @Field(() => ID)
  id!: string

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  name?: string

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  email?: string

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  bio?: string

  @Field(() => UserRole, { nullable: true })
  role?: UserRole
}
```

### Resolvers

For GQL Assist to recognize and convert a resolver method, it should be placed in a file with the
extension `.resolver.ts`.

#### Example

Given the following TypeScript class:

```ts
export class UserResolver {
  user(id: string, context: GQLContext) {
    return null
  }
}
```

GQL Assist will convert it to:

```ts
import { Args, Context, ID, Query, Resolver } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@Resolver()
export class UserResolver {
  @Query()
  user(
    @Args({ name: 'id', type: () => ID })
    id: string,

    @Context()
    context: GQLContext,
  ) {
    return null
  }
}
```

### Field Resolvers

For GQL Assist to recognize and convert a field resolver method, it should be placed in a file with
the extension `.resolver.ts`.

#### Example

Given the following TypeScript class:

```ts
@Resolver(() => User)
export class UserResolver {
  fullName(parent: UserType) {}
}
```

GQL Assist will convert it to:

```ts
import { Parent, ResolveField, Resolver } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@Resolver(() => User)
export class UserResolver implements FieldResolver<User, UserType> {
  @ResolveField()
  fullName(
    @Parent()
    parent: UserType,
  ) {}
}
```

### Enums

For GQL Assist to recognize and convert enums, they should be placed in a file with the extension
`.enum.ts`.

#### Example

Given the following TypeScript enum:

```ts
export enum UserStatus {
  ACTIVE,
  INACTIVE,
}
```

GQL Assist will convert it to:

```ts
import { registerEnumType } from '@nestjs/graphql'

export enum UserStatus {
  ACTIVE = 'ACTIVE',
  INACTIVE = 'INACTIVE',
}

registerEnumType(UserStatus, { name: 'UserStatus' })
```

## Command: gql-assist

GQL Assist is a powerful tool designed to streamline the development of GraphQL APIs in a NestJS
environment. By automatically converting TypeScript classes, resolvers, and enums into their
corresponding GraphQL definitions, GQL Assist significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code
you need to write.
